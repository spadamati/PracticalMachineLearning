**Introduction**    

 Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.  

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.   

The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.The classe variable represents performing a Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).Note that these classes are unordered.
